This repository is built as a part of my " Design Principles for Programming Languages " course of my second year Undergraduate Studies. This repository includes codes for :<hr>
1. Long Integer Multiplication, by taking the numbers as 2 C language character arrays of some maximum length size constraint, and converting them to linked lists.<br><br>
2. Long Integer Division, by taking the numbers as 2 C language character arrays of some maximum length size constraint, and converting them to linked lists.<br><br>
3. Dynamic Long Integer Multiplication, by taking the numbers of Dynamic size, with no constraints.<br><br>
4. Classification of input data as Integer, String, and Float.<br><br>
