# Design Principles for Programming Languages

## üìã Project Overview

This repository was built as part of the **"Design Principles for Programming Languages"** course during my second year of undergraduate studies. It includes practical implementations of various programming language concepts and data structures, demonstrating core principles of language design and implementation.

## ‚ú® Main Features

### üî¢ Long Integer Operations
- **Long Integer Multiplication**: Implementation using C language character arrays (with maximum length constraints) converted to linked lists
- **Long Integer Division**: Similar approach for division operations using character arrays and linked lists
- **Dynamic Long Integer Multiplication**: Supports dynamically sized numbers with no size constraints

### üìä Data Processing
- **Input Data Classification**: Classifies input data as Integer, String, and Float types
- **Set Operations**: Implementation of sets and set operations through bit vectors
- **Basic Python Dictionary**: Custom implementation of a dictionary data structure

## üõ†Ô∏è Languages Used
- **C (100%)**: All implementations are written in C programming language

## üöÄ Installation & Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler or any C compiler
- Make utility (optional)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karri-Tirumala-Venkatesh/Design-Principles-of-Programming-Languages.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Design-Principles-of-Programming-Languages
   ```

### Usage
Compile and run individual programs:

```bash
# For long integer multiplication
gcc long_multiply.c -o long_multiply
./long_multiply

# For dynamic long multiplication
gcc dynamic_long_multiply.c -o dynamic_long_multiply
./dynamic_long_multiply

# For data type classification
gcc data_types.c -o data_types
./data_types

# For set operations
gcc set.c -o set
./set

# For dictionary implementation
gcc dictionary.c -o dictionary
./dictionary

# For long division
gcc long_division.c -o long_division
./long_division
```
